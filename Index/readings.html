	<h1>Reading Response 1: Touring Complete User
	</h1>
	<h2>What do you think is Lialinas opinion of the word “user”?
	</h2>
	<p>Lilalina doesn’t support the term user. She supports the idea introduced by Don Norman that there is no such a thing as user. It should be replaced by people, because in the end we design for people, not users. 
	</p>
	<h2>What is Lialina’s ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines
	</h2>
	<p>Lialina’s perfect user is “General Purpose User”. She talks mostly about how users suppose to adapt and use the web space for themselves. She strongly suggests the websites that are fully customizable by the user</p>
	<h2>From your own experience interacting on the web - what is an example where there are “gaps that can be filled by user”? 
	</h2>
	<p>There are many websites that cluttered with stuff, different pictures and etc. For example Pinterest. Personally for me I prefer not to go on it simply because it looks like trash of pictures framed in ugly frame, there for its confusing to the user and user can easily miss what they are looking for. And this what will happen if users get an access of fully customizing their page. I think it will increase amount of clutter and look very confusing. Simple is the key.

	<h1>Reading Response 2: the Poetry of Tools</h1>
	<h2>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
	</h2>
	<p>
		In “The Poetry of Tools” article, Mindy Seu describes the relationship the reader has with their technology while reading an article. She describes an experience that majority of the people have on a day to day basis with their computer or any other tech supporting human interaction. She points out to the tools like type, click, send, swipe, and introduces her argument of reconstructing them. She wants to make the experience feel more natural, and less abnormal, as it become now. It has to relate back to the natural world use, that we experience everyday with other objects, and need to create that in the digital atmosphere. She uses word poetry to describe it, and I think its very good metaphor. When we hear a good written poetry, it goes with a flow, start doesn’t feel like start and end doesn’t feel like the end. Something very different from current experience that feels more task oriented.

	</p>
	<h2>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.
	</h2>
	<p><h3>SLOW GROWTH & SLOW DEATH</h3>
	Both examples provided in the article, demonstrate the life. First sample is about converting something unknown to people into something readable and demonstrating its life and progress through the web. Second is demonstrating the life of web itself. As time goes one generation dies and another comes after it. That website reminds me of a cemetery, but cemetery for one class that will die eventually.
</p>
	<p>Something that reminds me of this was on reddit before. It was up for 72hours only and was called Reddit Pixel Art. This demonstrated the quick progress and how everyone worked together on something that was unknown to anyone, and from blank page by the use of computer everyone communicated with one another to create something new. It demonstrated life, progress and death, especially considering that majority of the people could place only couple pixels and rest had to be filled up by someone else.
